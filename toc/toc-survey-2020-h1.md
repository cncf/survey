# CNCF TOC Survey 2020 H1

Greetings,

The Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) is regularly surveying the community to check levels of satisfaction and how the TOC can help more. This should take no more than a few minutes of your time. Also, for this survey, when we talk about SIGs we are referring to CNCF SIGs (https://github.com/cncf/toc/tree/master/sigs) but not the Kubernetes or other project-specific SIGs.
