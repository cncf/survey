Separately when you want to use them they are great, but to make them work together it is a nightmare. CNCF is missing a platform-like, integration projects that have a goal to integrate those different projects in one stack, and they work with those projects to improve their abilities to integrate. Cloud is complex, it is not enough to give someone a package of lego, lego duplo and building blocks from other vendors, without instruction, expecting they can easily build something out of it. You need project that make sure all those blocks are compatible and work well with each other.","Have a clear process for accepting/rejecting projects, that is always transparently followed and decisions are not made on closed meetings unless some company asked for it explicitly","I basically lost my belief in transparency of TOC work. Kyma was not allowed to present on public meeting. We were not checked in details and advised what has to change or to be done to get accepted. On a private TOC meeting there was a decision we get rejected, and then just communicated in PR, like it is just a usual case. Few hours later, after the decision (it all happened during KubeCon, when before KubeCon I got information that TOC will not have time to discuss the project with them and that we will cover that after KubeCon) one of the TOC members approach the booth and asked us to explain what Kyma is. He asked us what it is even though they already made a decision it is not a good project for CNCF.    Such things make others think TOC is still powered by private business of certain companies and projects are blocked as potential competition. I'm still believe it is not true, but if you treat like this a project from such a large company as SAP, you should take into accoutn that such a company can have long term doubts."

This applies to sandbox, incubation, and graduation projects.    2. Have TOC members regularly attend SIG and WG meetings. Unanswerable questions come up regularly and TOC members are not present to hear them.    3. TOC members regularly triage and engage with projects on the TOC GitHub repo. If the TOC is involved where the work is expected to happen around processes and questions it will help the TOC be more engaged and respond more quickly.

It would be much more effective for the TOC to be an architecture committee with substantial technical and architecture deliverables. Currently there are more polarizing non-technical views and discussion in the TOC, than anywhere else in the community or GB.","It would be great to see the TOC select more technical topics, either through SIGs or otherwise and create more forward looking technical guidance within the CNCF. This would allow the CNCF to be proactive and user centered vs. being reactive and vendor dependent."
