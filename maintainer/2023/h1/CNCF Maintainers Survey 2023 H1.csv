On a more technical perspective, the project will need some extra assistance for maintaining and improving the open infrastructure that runs all our automated workflows and supports our development activity.",7,"In general, CNCF contributors and its staff have been very approacheable and available. The optimality of on the interactions with the CNCF for our project has so far been dependent on the kind of request and who's volunteering to respond. For example, the conversations about improving our open infrastructure and estimating its cost took longer than I expected.",7,,8,"I think that the entities and their roles, along with the associated processes, are properly documented and that newcomers can easily find their way to engage with the TOC and the TAGs. One downside is the occasional reliance on synchronous periodic communication, which can potentially make it more difficult to participate for community members in less favorable time zones or that are not fluent in english.",8,"My personal experience is mostly associated with DevStats, which in the past have been a truly valuable tool for monitoring the trends and activity in our project's community.",6,"The TOC has the duty of following and assisting many projects, and so I think the bandwidth of its members is generally limited. This can occasionally cause inconsistent support and delayed responses. Among the TOC sponsors of our project in its ongoing journey for graduation, only one of them had consistent and steady communication with the project's maintainers group, both asynchronously and in person at KubeCon.","For our project, I think the most valuable benefits have been the on-site spaces for the Project Pavillion and the Project Meeting at the KubeCon in-person events.","Our project already moved levels from Sandbox to Incubating, and is currently under review for becoming a Graduated project. The process of moving levels is being increasily documented but it's still not entirely clear in my opinion. When working on the documents and resource necessary for moving levels, the expectation would be to receive a fair review by fulfilling all the documented requirements one by one. However, for our project the review process took quite some time (which is expectable considering the limited bandwidth of the TOC), and we received some pushback and re-iterated on some points due to undocumented requirements or not fully transparent criteria. Among those, I think that for us some of the most relevant pain points have been the irregular communication with the TOC and its sponsoring members, and the graduation goals being altered during the review phase. Overall, I think active and precise communication could prevent this kind of issues, along with defining an exhaustive and non-arbitrary list of goals for the change of levels.","I think that the documented parts of the process are overall satisfactory. The issues we've faced as maintainers of our project are mostly related to opaque, implicit, or undocumented requirements encountered later during the review phase. The general feeling was similar to facing a meticulous examination without being certain on how to come fully prepared. This made us put extra focus in parts that turned out being less significant than expected, and overlook details that the TOC considered more relevant without prior notice.","I think the CNCF could provide further assistance to projects moving levels, specially to those aiming to graduation. This could be attained by allocating dedicated staff members for supervising the process full time, to better guarantee maximum transparency and uniformity to all the applying projects.",

However, there is a desire for more standardization and level setting of requirements across projects, including those that have already graduated. While each project addresses a unique and challenging problem, some projects face additional difficulties. For example, Falco, as a security monitoring tool, requires specialized knowledge in multiple domains, and tackling security challenges can be particularly demanding. It is important to consider these differences when evaluating success criteria, whether it's graduation or adoption success stories.","One potential service that the CNCF could consider providing is offloading technical trainings or tutorials that go beyond the scope of individual projects. This could involve offering resources on topics such as the Linux kernel, key security concepts, or data pipeline and data analysis concepts that are relevant to multiple projects within the CNCF ecosystem.

For instance, the absence of an established procedure for addressing concerns or escalating discussions could be improved. More details will follow in subsequent responses.",8,"The support for marketing and events has been great. We had a great time at the project pavilion at the last Kubecon. It was a fantastic place to meet users, discover other projects, and make new friends.

Finally, our awareness of scholarships and other services that CNCF offers is limited.",7,"Interactions with the CNCF team are dependable and steady. We're grateful that Amye, Chris, and the marketing team are approachable and always open to discussions. However, for those contributing on a voluntary basis, the engagement tends to be inconsistent. Further details on this will be provided in the following answers.",5,I've primarily used the CNCF service desk. I can't say I have a good understanding of all resources and programs available.,7,"Although processes are documented, engaging with TAGs is challenging due to synchronous communication demands, like video and Slack. This is tricky for global open-source projects due to time zones and language barriers, leading to one-sided discussions. Preferring asynchronous communications, like emails, could equalize time zone differences and grant non-native English speakers more response time, possibly mandating all critical decisions on mailing lists with an acceptable response window.",7,"I've used DevStats, and I found it overall valuable though the data is not always accurate.",3,"It appears that the TOC has not enough capacity, leading to delayed responses, variable support, or engagement levels. We applied for graduation, and among our project's TOC sponsors, only one maintained consistent involvement with us. This resulted in mismatched expectations between the TOC and our project.",Not sure.,"The process for advancing levels can appear unclear. Despite TOC's documented processes and the belief that fulfilling all requirements paves the way for a fair graduation review, the experience often falls short. Reviews are time-consuming, and unexpectedly, projects sometimes confront requirements not documented initially. Feedback often arrives late, and regular communication from TOC sponsors seems to be lacking. We've faced moving graduation targets mid-review, which could have been prevented with earlier communication. Overall, the lack of precise requirements, inconsistent communication, and, most importantly, the alteration of evaluation criteria after a project has applied to progress levels do not result in a satisfactory experience.","The documented criteria for graduation appear to be good. However, the challenge arises from the undocumented, variable requirement I've encountered in my personal experience (and I've heard similar rumors from other projects). Ideally, CNCF should focus on aiding projects transition to the next level with TOC guidance rather than imposing what feels like a rigorous examination with unclear and shifting requirements. In this regard, a concern seems to be the volunteer-only nature of the TOC, leading to inconsistent communication and standards. I propose that CNCF appoints a dedicated staff member to oversee the process, ensuring uniformity, equitable information sharing, and a more dependable and transparent procedure.","- Assisting and advising projects on how to advance to higher levels should be part of the services offered by CNCF. - An event registration platform that can be seamlessly integrated with project websites, such as Eventbrite or a similar tool.",
