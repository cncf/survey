I wasn't at the recent KubCon NA in Chicaco, but attendees told me that the room for the Prometheus maintainer track was extremely hard to find. Another impression was that OTel got a really nice and fancy booth via a corporate sponsorship, which gives the impression of ""pay to play"" and that projects will thrive ar wither depending on short term corporate interest, which is obviously true in real life anyway, but my hope was that a foundation like CNCF could act as a moderator between the industry players to create technical balance rather than just amplifying what would have happened without a foundation anyway (namely OSS projects only succeeding if they have a powerful corporate sponsor ""owning"" it).",N/A,,7,,7,,8,,N/A,,"""Rescuing"" PromCon (jumping in as a main sponsor etc.)when it was in rough waters post-pandemic.",Prometheus moved up the ranks very early and easily.

For KubeCon stuff we can't fault the response times.,5,See comments for q10,4,"It's hard to know what's out there.

At the same time, it's getting harder to justify continuous investment in the project to people who often aren't as familiar with open source or who (justifiably) look for financial return on their investments of time and money. This seems an existential risk for projects like cert-manager - we have a fantastically wide variety of maintainers and contributors from many companies but the vast majority of day-to-day maintainer time is sponsored by one company (who pay several maintainers to work at least part time on the project). If that support dries up, someone else might step up - or it's entirely possible nobody would and the project could stagnate. I've heard this story from several other projects both within and outside of the CNCF. The gold standard would be to help pay, sponsor or provide connections for existing maintainers to become independent of any company. Having a truly netural maintainer who has little or minimal corporate involvement would be tremendous but is currently likely to be financially prohibitive for all currently active maintainers. Lots of people desperately want the project to succeed and to continue to succeed. Given the number of people who depend on cert-manager, I firmly believe that there should be sufficient finance out there to fund one or more dedicated full time independent maintainers. Being able to connect long term maintainers with in larger companies who might be willing to step up with financial support would be a lot of help.","Being able to give a project update as an incubating project in the KubeCon Chicago keynote was awesome! However, we intentionally omitted mentioning Venafi (who sponsor the vast majority of maintainer time) to try to stay independent and vendor netural. Several other projects quite gladly namedropped their companies alongside their project update. We don't want to do a sales pitch but we'd like to be on a level playing field - if some projects are namedropping, we'd like to do so as well. Otherwise we're fine leaving out the namedrop - as long as everyone else does! Consistency is key."
