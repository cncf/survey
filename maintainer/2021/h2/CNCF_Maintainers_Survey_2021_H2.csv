I'm sharing it as I've heard it from co-maintainers who work as engineers on Flux. I, as a comms person of the project, can deal with the amount of communications a lot better.    We as the Flux project should potentially get more folks involved in groups like e.g. the maintainers circle to learn more from others and use CNCF resources more efficiently and collaborate across projects a bit more. That'd be more on us than on the CNCF."
