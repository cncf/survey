Does CNCF have specific thoughts on CI? I checked this box only as a potential conversation starter. I've been doing a lot of research, development, and collaboration with existing CI/CD projects, and am particularly interested in cloud-native (my ideal is kubernetes-native) CI. Would love to learn more about what you're thinking.

I'm interested to see what governance will look like as a CNCF incubator project compared to being within the overall (extremely well structured IMO) kubernetes project governance.

Helm has been very good about documentation, though it's an ongoing effort - one I have planned to put more time into - especially best practices, and helping with overall consistency of those among the stable (and incubating) community Charts. I still checked the ""documentation"" survey box because I'm thinking about the CNCF cloud native landscape docs and overall community/information advocacy. (also my reason for checking ""social"" and ""marketing"").

What will upcoming Helm Summits look like as a CNCF project? Only positive thoughts there.

Lastly, I checked the ""certification/conformance"" box because - as we've talked about before - I would like to see k8s classes/certifications include tools like Helm and other topics, such as under what circumstances a developer would choose one tool or another from the CNCF landscape chart, help educate and stimulate varying points of view on the pros and cons, etc. Looking forward to continuing that conversation!"

Kubernetes is undoubtedly the most significant project in the CNCF, but its share of talks at CloudNativeCon still seems disproportionately large, with it having an order of magnitude more talks than the next biggest project. How much is CloudNativeCon basically still supposed to be ""KubeCon"", which might explain that? That was never really clear to me with the double naming.

Some CfP selection choices *within* the Prometheus talks were also hard to understand as they didn't reflect the scoring that Prometheus team members had given, e.g. to some of the talks we really felt should be included. I would recommend that a given project's team should get more of a say in the final selection of talks about its own project."
