We have since changed our expectations and are waiting to engage on integration with CNCF CI v2.",,,3,,,"We have not had any security audits performed, I was not aware of the security services offered by the CNCF.",,,3,,,"I wasn't aware of any tooling functionality the CNCF offers, so I haven't been able to take advantage of them",,,,,5,"Kubecons are amazing and the opportunities we get to connect with the community on the maintainer track is great, and the conference presence of the Rook logo/name is great too.  We have also had great visibility on twitter from the CNCF account.",,,,,5,"I spoke about this in a New Stack podcast interview alongside Ihor.  2 things I think the CNCF provides most notably: 1) Technical vetting, getting accepted to the CNCF and especially at the Incubation level is a great approval of the project for the broader community to feel safe adopting it.  It's a respected stamp of approval.  2) Reach - the amount of visibility we get to the broader ecosystem by being a CNCF project is great.  Most people at Kubecons have heard of Rook now, so that marketing reach is really impressive and helpful.","It may be cool to do something in the same vein that Google Summer of Code does.  Perhaps set up a few stipends for people that want to contribute to CNCF projects but don't have the resources.  This could encourage and incentive many new contributors to join the CNCF project communities.  I think this could be done at any time of the year, as opposed to run as a specific time period for everyone like GSoC does it.  Getting more diverse folks from all around the world involved in the CNCF projects would be awesome!","What I'm noticing that I've personally missed is the reach and awareness of all the services that are offered by the CNCF.  Security audits, bots/automation, etc. I didn't even know were available.  I take responsibility for that of course too, but there could be a more vocal and visible campaign from the CNCF to make these services well known by the projects.  I think maintainers don't necessarily even know what their project needs.  Perhaps the CNCF can have full project reviews and explicitly state/offer what services the project needs or should take advantage of.  Looks like there are some great services and we as a maintainer team have not been taking advantage of them.","I think my biggest point is in the last question about visibility of the CNCF services.  I'd love a CNCF expert to do a review of the Rook project and say hey we have service x, y, and z that would really benefit you all.  I take responsibility that we haven't taken the initiative ourselves, but having an expert from the CNCF that knows all the services and how they can be utilized reaching out to all the projects could make these services more available and utilized as a whole.  The visibility and technical approval that the CNCF has given us has been incredible, I am very pleased and grateful for that.  Keep up the great work!"
