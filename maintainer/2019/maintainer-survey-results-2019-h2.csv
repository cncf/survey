Help getting our docs in order... IMO it's related to marketing in the same way that the website is.  Visibility at KubeCon - as a sandbox project, we don't get much. We've historically had many talks at KubeCons past but for some reason only one got through this year in North America even though many quality talks were submitted. I don't expect the selection committee to be required to select CNCF project talks, however this year definitely feels like we got a little cold shouldered for whatever reason.",Help with technical writing. Our docs need some serious love and they are badly impacting the project optics.,I think most of my feelings are captured above :) thank you! Happy to talk further if you like.
