They are responsive and helpful.    To be part of the CNCF takes on other elements including dealing with the CNCF TOC. The TOC is scoped with the technical direction of the CNCF. To help with that they have created SIGs. Sometimes SIGs are helpful, such as recent work on governance and contributor experience by experienced professions. Other times the SIGs add work to CNCF projects and even do things that add more work to CNCF projects. All of this SIG work is mostly without TOC oversight.    Projects that come into the CNCF need to have the time and ability to work in this structure. Maintainers need to have time to attend meetings, engage, and sometimes tell SIG chairs no. Like when SIG chairs try to tell maintainers to make changes to their projects that aren't TOC requirements for anything (I've seen this happen). Not every maintainer has this time or has a personality that can tell A type personalities no.    So, I would recommend the CNCF to certain types of maintainers who can use the benefits while being able to deal with some of the negative aspects.
