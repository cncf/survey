We'd like it if the SIGs de-emphasized their role as ""overseeing"" projects (which seems to entail believing they can tell us what to do). We had envisioned CNCF as a place where high quality projects could pool resources and IP. Instead, we feel like CNCF is increasingly becoming an extra ""management chain"" that we have to report to."

First, the technical vetting and due dilligence for a project to be accepted is great and puts a stamp of approval and trust on a new project.  Second, the marketing and visibility from the CNCF is really good and gets the project to a broader audience.  This worked great for Rook since we were a very early project, perhaps more recent projects are having a different experience that could perhaps be more diluted with the higher number of projects.  That is probably counter-balanced though by the improved processes, programs, tooling, support, etc. that the CNCF provides.  All of that has come a long way and is really quite good now.",The GSoC participation and support has been really good for Rook.,"If Rook is to graduate soon, a marketing push and announcements would be really awesome around that!",CI/CD hosting and/or donations of free credits to existing AWS and GCP accounts.,I think the line-up of services that the CNCF offers has come a really long way and Rook has taken advantage of more of them than we used to.

My suggestions:    - have a technical person (or two, or three) work in marketing.

From the Zuul website: ""Zuul is a gateway service that provides dynamic routing, monitoring, resiliency, security, and more.""  - staff a technical doc team that can write blog posts on CNCF technology -- imagine if graduated projects got 1 blog post/month; incubation projects got 1 blog post/quarter; sandbox projects got 1 blog post every 6 months; etc. this would help educate users.  - I think the real value CNCF can provide is connecting community members with each other (e.g., we'd love to find more maintainers). that hasn't happened.

On a related note, maybe a project management tool like zenhub can also be a good addition.    "
