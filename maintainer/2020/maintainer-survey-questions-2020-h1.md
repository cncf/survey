# CNCF Maintainers Survey 2020 H1
Greetings,

The Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) is regularly surveying the project maintainers to check levels of satisfaction and how the foundation can help more. This is the regular CNCF Maintainers Survey, H1 2020 edition and should take no more than a few minutes of your time. We will open source the survey results later removing all PII (identifying) information: https://github.com/cncf/surveys

We are happy to hear your comments - please, fill out the survey by March 6.
