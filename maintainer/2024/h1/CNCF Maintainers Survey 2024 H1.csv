I think in the past when we reached out there was a big backlog.,I though at KubeCon Amsterdam ambassadors would be assigned to help evagalize different CNCF projects. I thought Knative had one assigned (Andy?) but they never followed up.

Neither,Argo Workflows,No,,Yes,"Other Argo projects, k8s, kOps, Istio, Kubeflow (in the past 6 months IIRC). Also other LF/OpenSSF projects",8,"Lots of resources, esp dev & collab tools & credits, help desk, brand name",4,"Budget is ambiguous and rarely used, despite folks working in their free time. Paying folks for some of their work, esp those with advanced knowledge in areas the project is weaker (e.g. Security, UI, Technical Writing), I think would be good for sustainability and encouragement.

Lots of metrics, but not particularly insightful. CloMontor feels unfair and pushed on us - by promoting wrong data (which we have to fix). DevStats felt borderline illegal (had to aggressively opt-out of data harvesting through PRs despite never consenting to this data harvesting).",N/A,,github actions. basically don't use anything else.,"CNCF asked if we wanted to, I said yes, but then never heard back. This was in the middle of the review process that took forever.",seems fine on paper if it's what's being followed. but also don't see much benefit for us in going up the ladder either.,1. renovatebot. 2. cncf mastodon. we should not be relying on twitter (and we have cancelled all our presence there). 3. dedicated Kubernetes test cluster access,i am happy that we generally don't need to interact much. no one is really pushing too hard for us to do things.
