* The tech writers promised by other platinum members
* The metrics dashboard
* The service desk
* More budget transparency

One more area to think about, maybe similar to the documentation effort: TPMs. K8s has >200 monthly active contributors. Most of those are full-time. Yet there is no centralized management of any form. It's very hard to organize, and much of the organization is performed by engineers on the project. It's very hard to even keep track of what's going on at this point. We could easily use ~4 TPMs."

- Helping us engage external writers for work.
- Providing some help around best practices on structuring docs
- Providing guidelines and any other feedback to help ensure high quality docs.

Still really want help with integration testing (specifically, access to a free cluster where we can run tests against K8s, Prometheus, etc) but I don't know where to get this.

Still want help with improving documentation but I don't know where to get this.
