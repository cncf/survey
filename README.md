One of CNCF's values are being [open](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/charter.md#3-values) and transparent. We take a data driven approach to serving our communities. We have open sourced routine survey data from our various constituencies to ensure we are always meeting their needs and improving over time.
