","I think that sponsoring ContainerDays and Enterprise Cloud Native Summit would be beneficial for the CNCF.    After KubeCon Europe, ContainerDays is the oldest and largest Kubernetes community event in Central Europe. Last year, ContainerDays attracted more than 1,100 attendees to Hamburg.    Benefit for the CNCF: Visibility within the Central European Kubernetes Community (CNCF did sponsor ContainerDays before and some of our attendees asked why it is no longer doing so because it seems somehow obvious to them that the CNCF should be there.)     Enterprise Cloud Native Summit seeks to empower IT decision makers to manage the cloud native transformation. The conference is clearly targeted towards IT decision makers in medium-sized and large companies. The first edition last fall was very successfull with 400 participants and speakers from i.a. Allianz, BMW and Zalando.    Benefit for the CNCF: Visibility with an audience that might not be very much aware of the importance and activities of the CNCF and the cloud native ecosystem yet.
