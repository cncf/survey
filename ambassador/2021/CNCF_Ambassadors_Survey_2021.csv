But it's a long waiting list. Not sure what can be done though. Other than offering more spots per member? ,I'm not sure. I think they provide a lot.,It would be great if the monthly marketing meeting could be completed 30 mins (at least the agenda portion). If they started on time and jumped right in with the agenda we could save at least 10 minutes there. They could offer Q&A at the end for an extra 10 minutes if there's time but many people have to drop after 30 minutes and the meeting could be run more efficiently with a little more focus. The slides are provided so we don't need to walk through each one every meeting. We could focus on current events and be more efficient.
